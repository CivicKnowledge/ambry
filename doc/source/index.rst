Ambry Data Management
=====================

Ambry is a data management system for packaging, storing and referencing research datasets, with an emphasis on public data. Using Ambry, you can create packages of data, in a similar way that source code packages can be created using tools like Apt, Homebrew, Bower or doezns of others. These pckages can be stored in libraries and installed to databases and data repositories. See the :ref:`Overview <about_overview>` for examples of use.
