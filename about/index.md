Data Bundles are packages of data that simplify the process of finding, cleaning, transforming and loading popular datasets. The data bundle format, tools and management processes are designed to make common public data sets easy to use and share, while allowing users to audit how the data they use has been acquired and processed. The Data Bundle concept includes the data format, a definition for bundle configuration and meta data, tools for manipulating bundles, and a process for acquiring, processing and managing data. The goal of a data bundle is for data analysts to be able to run few simple commands to find a dataset and load it into a relational database.

Data Bundles are designed for high-value public datasets, such as census, economic reports, crime data, records of contracts, and other public data sets that many people use on a regular basis. For these data, it is important to be able to verify where the data originated and understand how the data was processed. Different users may require the same original data to be post processed in different ways, and occasionally, data may be corrected or updated. Unlike a traditional data warehouse environment, Data Bundles are designed for an environment where instead of a "single version of the truth" user want to know which version of the truth they have.
