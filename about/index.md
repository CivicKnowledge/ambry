# Answer Data Questions in 20% of the Time 

When we started the [San Diego Regional Data Library](http://sandiegodata.org), we interviews a lot of people about hwow they use data. One theme was repeated frequently by data journalists, non profit analysts, epidemiologists and data scientists: 80% of the time spent on their data projects was consumed with getting and preparing data, with the remaining 20% left for all of the tasks that provided the real value.  Ambry was designed to solve this problem: _how can the people who need data to answer questions for civic and social development skip the gruntwork and get data drived answers quickly and inexpensivley?_

The reason data projects are expensive is because they are run in a craft mode of production, with a single data analysts performing most of the steps, with no formal process, no quality control and for a single customer. To make data less expensive, we need to shift to industrial production, which requires specialization, standardization, and delivery to a mass market.

<div class="alert alert-info">See <a href="http://www.sandiegodata.org/reports/a-vision-for-shared-data-infrastructure/">A Vision for a Shared Data Infrastructure</a> for a more detailed discussion about the data process and how to reduce costs with specialization, standardization, and mass markets.</div>

Ambry provides a framework for packaging, sharing and installing data. It creates a standard container for data that allows specialists to collaborate, and makes it easier to find data, fix errors, and share results.
