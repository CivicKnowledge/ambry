title: 'Ambry Overview: Comprehensive Data Package Management'
---

The Ambry Data Management system is similar to software package management systems like yum, apt-get or brew, including both support for creating bundles and for using them. Ambry collects tabular or geographic data into bundle which can be installed in databases or file systems. The divisions of the lifecycle of an AMbry bundle is: 

* Source Development. Creating the bundle
* Library Storage. Storing the bundle into a Library
* Finding a bundle. Locating a bundle in a library. 
* Installation. Storing the data into a file, database or other repository
* Use. Using the data for analysis, or for creating another bundle. 

## Source Development

Ambry bundle development involved creating a Python file for code and an YAML file for configuration. 

## Library Storage

After the bundle is created, it can be installed in a Library, either a local private library, or a remote library that can be acessible to others. 

## Finding a Bundle

To find a bundle users attach to and syncrhonize with one or more libraries, then use Ambry's search features to find the bundles they are interested in. 

## Installation

Installation means putting the data bundle into a useful form. Bundles can be installed to relational databases, NoSQL databases, CSV fiels, Shapefiles, or even used in their Sqlite Storage format. 

## Use

Using a database. 

Using the Bundles directly.
