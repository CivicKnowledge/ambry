Destination Schema
==================

The destination schemas is the main and most important schema in an Ambry bundle. It defines the tables of the output files, along with the data types of each column, and, in many cases, the transformation process for altering the data values. 

The destination schema can often be created automatically from the upstream source files, but it is more common to edit the schemas, sometimes creating them programatically from other inputs. 

Topics:

- Auto create the schemas
- Basic datatypes
- Advanced valuetypes
- Transformations
