The install.sh script have been tested to work with Ubuntu 12.04 and Mac OS X 10.8.
On Os X, the install script requires the Homebrew package manager, 
http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/

Running install.sh will create a Python virtualenv that installs this bundle, so
to avoid having to download the bundle write, you can run the script from the 
web with:

	curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clarinova/ambry/master/support/install.sh | sh -s ~/Bundles
	
Where you replace "~/Bundles" with the directory where you want to install
the virtualenv. github
